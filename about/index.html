                Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic, Rumuola is one of the
                Polytechnics in Rivers State. The Polytechnic has a long and
                eventful history. Its pedigree and role in the educational
                advancement of Rivers States and the nation cannot be over
                emphasized.

                The Polytechnic was established in 1977 as a School of Basic
                studies to offer Higher School Certificate/Advanced level GCE,
                Interim Joint Matriculation Board Examination (IJMBE) moderated
                by Ahmadu Bello University, Matriculation Examination Programme
                (MEP) moderated by Rivers State University of Science and
                Technology and the Remedial Programmes, UTME, JAMB/GCE
                preparatory classes.

                In 1992 due to its success and educational relevance the School
                of Basic Studies was converted to Rivers State College of Arts
                and Science to award College Diploma and Certificates in
                addition to its original programmes. This conversion provided
                the opportunities to those who otherwise would have been denied
                access to tertiary education.
              </section>
              <section class="mt-3">
                In 2006 the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE)
                accredited four programmes namely: National Diploma Accountancy,
                National Diploma Statistics, National Diploma Computer Science
                and Pre-National Diploma Science thereby elevating the College
                to a Polytechnic status. In 2010 the National Board for
                Technical Education (NBTE) granted accreditation to three (3)
                additional programmes at National Diploma (ND) and Higher
                National Diploma (HND) levels. Following this development Rivers
                State Government responded to infrastructural challenges/needs
                of the institution.
